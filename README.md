# Purpose

## Static fix for rocketeer SSH issues due to an old phpseclib

see: https://github.com/rocketeers/rocketeer/issues/755

Since the original library is abandoned, I created this fork of version 4.2 to update the related phpseclib/phpseclib package.
It is working for my purposes using rocketeers/rocketeer, but I can neither guarantee its stability nor its maintenance.

# Maintenance

This fork is a static fix only and will NOT be maintained.
